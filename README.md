# By the Power of Truth

A mobile app that brings together different news sources from across the political spectrum in order to minimise confirmation bias.

This app has a backend server which we built and deploy using Heroku. It can be found [here](https://github.com/EdinaBMakers/PowerOfTruthServer) along with information on how to use the API.

## Documentation

We created a [wiki](https://github.com/rayswilling/PowerOfTruth/wiki) page which has notes from all our stand ups and retros. We used [trello](https://trello.com/b/RDFMIatH/foxy-news) to assign tasks.   

## Setup

- Clone this repository
- Navigate into the root directory
- Run `npm install` from the command line.
- `brew install yarn`
- `yarn global add expo-cli`
- Launch the application: `yarn start`
- The browser will open. Select `Run on ios simulator`


## Testing

We use Jest to test our app. To run the full test suite,
- Run `npm test` from the project root

- To update the snapshot: `npm test -- -u`

## User Stories
These were the user stories that were implemented in the timeframe given for this project. These include the user stories for the Minimum Viable Product as well as some of the additional features we managed to fit in. The 'Nice to Have' section below contains the user stories that we would have liked to fit in had we had more time.

```

For this final user story we had planned to use the SummarizeBot API, which uses machine learning to analyse individual articles to provide an estimation on how likely an article is to be biased or trustworthy.
